# Introduction
### Where is the safest county and state to live in the US?  By Jake Lieberfarb
This is an analysis of Storm events from 2018-2019 to see which state and its respective county are the safest for an individual to life. Data was pulled from a [NOAA dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp). "Safe" is defined as the state which sees a low total property damage brought on by storm events proportional to its size. Below are the questions asked to get to the final conclusion on which state and their county are the safest for someone to live in.
