# Introduction
### Where is the safest county and state to live in the US?  By Jake Lieberfarb
This is an analysis of storm events from 2018-2019 to see which state and county are the safest for an individual to life. Data was pulled from a [NOAA dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp). "Safe" is defined as the state which sees low total property damage brought on by storm events proportional to its size. Below are the questions and their corresponding visuals asked to get to the final conclusion on which state and county are the safest for someone to live in.

## Conclusion and other links 


The two safest counties to live in based on counts of weather events would be Delaware Beaches county, Delaware and Lincoln or Teton County, Wyoming. One should move to Delaware in late Winter-early Spring or to Wyoming in September if they want to limit their chances of encountering a weather event. Delaware Beaches only had 8 weather events in 2018 and 6 in 2019. Lincoln county only had one weather event in 2018 and two weather events in 2019. Teton county had one weather event in 2018 and two in 2019. In regards to the most weather events each state had by year, in 2018 Delaware had 19 flash floods and 14 costal floods. In 2019 Delware had 80 thunderstorms and 20 hail storms. For Wyoming in 2018 it had 564 cases of high winds, and 259 cases of hail storms. In 2019, Wyoming had 319 hail storms and 236 cases of high winds. Although the types of weather events change for each state per year, these states will not be dealing with cataqstrophic events such as tornados on a regular basis. heat and excessive heat take most peoples' lives each year.
